# **Java Credit Card System**

This repository tracks my hands-on journey in learning Java by building a Credit Card Management System. It moves beyond simple exercises to create a functional, console-based application that demonstrates how to manage objects and state in a real-world scenario.

The project is designed to solidify my understanding of:

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Implementing classes for Card, Account, and Transaction, focusing on encapsulation and class relationships.

2. State Management: Handling card balance, purchase limits, and simulating successful/failed transactions.

3. Control Flow & Logic: Implementing rules for credit limits, interest calculation (basic), and payment processing.

This is a work-in-progress and a space for applying learned concepts. Feel free to browse and use it as a reference for your own learning!
